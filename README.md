# Silhouette-Method
Python Implementation of Silhouette Method to determine optimal clusters and also to measure goodness of fit of accuracy technique.

# Execution
Clone the repository and open the .ipynb file on Google Colab and run.




In the example above, k = 4 is the optimum number of clusters because the Silhouette Coefficient value is the highest.
Furthermore, the Silhouette Coefficient for each cluster is greater than the average Silhouette Coefficient and no rapid fluctuation is visible in the thickness of Silhouette plot
